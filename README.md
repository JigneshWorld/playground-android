# Mobile - CI/CD - Android

What's Included in this Project? ðŸ“¦

âœ…  [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) using Pull Requests & Squash-Merge \
    Generally, we protect `master` branch [this way](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches). \
    For now, protected `master` branch push using `git config branch.master.pushRemote no_push`

âœ…  Continuous Integration - Lint, Unit Test, Integration Test, and Build using GitHub Actions \
    We can add more tools like sonar cube, danger, code coverage, screenshots etc 

âœ…  Continuous Deployment - Deploy App to Firebase App Distribution using Fastlane on Github Actions \
    Notify Internal Testing Team with Specified Release Notes \
    We can add any platform's deployment workflow including Google Play. \

**Requirements**
- Write your application in Kotlin
- Ensure your application looks good on different screen sizes and densities
- Ensure your application supports Android API 23+
- Use good architecture and design patterns
- Use valuable external libraries that you are used to
- Use reactive programming

**Bonus** 
- Filtering and ordering functionalities
- Unit tests
- Shared element transition or other animations (but only if they are functional to the user experience)

If there is something not specified, please be free to decide on it. 
Let us know if you need something or you have any doubt about the project.
